    "__Description__ : This module contains the functions neccessary to perform the masking procedures for the dashboard reports for each of the programs. Primary masking hides low counts in range (0,10] by chaning the cell value to _*1_. Secondary masking is performed for categories of the same group, or for each column, to prevent deduction of the primarily masked cell by arithmetics. In other words, if a cell in a related group is primarily masked, then the next lowest cell count in that group will be secondarily masked.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Example: A row of data has value [5,*1] for columns [Male, Female]. The value of -999 may be calculated by subtracting [5] from the row total. Secondary masking will transform this group to [*2,*1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "__General Procedure__: The module accepts unmasked Excel report files, and split the report into separate dataframes for each geography level (e.g.: State Assembly, State Senate etc.) Note that the unmasked Excel files are already primarily masked, but with values of -999 instead of _*1_ . The function _createGroupdict_ generates a Python dictionary of related cell groups, depending on the program. This dictionary is used to performed horizontal masking, which iterates through each row, by each group to check whether secondary masking is needed. After the rows have been checked, each column is also tested by similar logic, as arithmetic deduction may be done vertically as well. Finally, the separate dataframes are re-joined together to match the original shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "__General Sequence__:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Step 1. Run createGroupDict to create dictionary of horizontal groups _([Male,Female],[Asian, Black, White, Hispanic, Native  Am./other/missing])_.\n",
    "*  Step 2. Run batchMask, wich first calls splitReport to separete dataframes by geographical levels. Then calls horizontalMask and verticalMask sequentially on them for masking. Finally re-join them into a single dataframe again. \n",
    "*   Step 3. Export masked dataframe to new Excel file."
